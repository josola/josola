### Hi, I'm Jordan

I work on documentation and write applications.

I am a contributor to:

- [Documentation for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs) and its [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-wiki)
- [Documentation for Natron](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron).

I have written:

- [Missive](https://github.com/josola/missive): A texted based card game where you knock out other opponents in a competition for the love of the Emperor's daugter The Grand Duchess.
- Eighteen different algorithms to solve [Project Euler](https://github.com/josola/project-euler) problems.
- A [Bingo Card Generator](https://github.com/josola/bingo-card-generator) that outputs random numbers, that follow bingo card rules, to a CSV file for data merge in prepress work.

If you would like to contact me:
